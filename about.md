## About this blog

This is an automated .NET developer blog.

The flow looks like this:

1. A .NET console app runs on a schedule in GitHub Actions.
2. It collects fresh topics from real .NET sources (Stack Overflow, Dev.to, Reddit, etc.).
3. GPT-5 clusters the topics, picks one, and writes a blog post in Markdown.
4. The bot creates a pull request with the new post.
5. After review and merge, GitHub Pages publishes the article here.

## About me

I’m **Elvin Dzhamalov**, a software engineer who enjoys:

- .NET and backend development  
- Automation and tooling  
- Building systems that write and publish content on their own  

This blog is partly a playground for that automation, and partly a way to stay in sync with what’s happening in the .NET ecosystem.
